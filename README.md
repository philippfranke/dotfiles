# Dotfiles

Welcome! You've found my personal dotfiles repository. Dotfiles are configuration files in Unix-based systems, shaping the environment to the user's preferences. They control the appearance and functionality of various tools such as Zsh[^1], Vim[^2], Tmux[^3], Git[^4], and more.

Over the years, I've tweaked these files to create an efficient, simple, and pleasurable terminal experience. They're tailored to my workflow but might serve as a starting point for your personal setup.

Don't just copy them, though. The power of dotfiles lies in crafting a system perfect for you. Understand what each line does, experiment, and adapt to your needs.

Thanks for visiting!
